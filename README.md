code for running the SMAUG analysis 
Single Molecule Analysis by Unsupervised Gibbs sampling accurately and precisely determines a number of parameter values from single molecule tracking data


Written by Josh Karslake at the University of Michigan.

## Installation

Download the entire folder and unzip if you downloaded the .zip folder. Change the working directory in Matlab to this folder and call the functions in the Matlab command window.

## Usage

Ill make a User Guide for SMAUG soon but basically run "SMAUG" in matlab and then select your track files. 
Using either our labs' Masterfit3 or SMALL-labs code to make the tracks is easiest. for unique data see User guide
